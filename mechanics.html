      <!-- DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME MECHANICS -->
      <!-- FROM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Remains_of_Edith_Finch -->
      What Remains of Edith Finch is a narrative-focused walking simulator. As
      Edith, the player explores the Finch house and surrounding wilderness
      through a semi-linear series of rooms, footpaths, crawlspaces, and
      secret passages. Edith's narration guides the player, providing
      commentary on her own thoughts, experiences, and relations to each
      character; and therefore provides exposition and nuance relating to many
      of the semi-self-contained sequences in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various narrative-related objects including books, clutter, and
      decorations provide Edith this opportunity; which is framed as the
      vocalization of Edith's own writings in her journal revealed
      chronologically as she makes her way through the house. Throughout
      which, the player encounters the former bedrooms of deceased family
      members which have been memorialized and preserved since the time of the
      respective individual's death. However having the option to skip
      multiple sequences, the player interacts with objects placed at these
      memorials to progress through the story, each of which inspire a unique
      vignette revealing the circumstances of each person's death.

    <p>
      These vignettes vary wildly in medium, perspective, genre, stylization,
      and gameplay mechanics, as well as intent and veracity of their source;
      therefore providing a series of unique and semi-self-contained stories
      throughout the game, oftentimes evoking themes of magical realism, the
      total accuracy of which the player is made to doubt.
