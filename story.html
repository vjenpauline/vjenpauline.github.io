        <p> <!-- PART 1 TEXT OF THE STORY -->
          The player character takes a ferry to Orcas Island, Washington
          carrying the journal of Edith Finch. The journal details Edith's
          experience returning to her ancestral home on the island for the
          first time in seven years. As a 17-year-old, Edith writes that she
          is the last surviving member of her family. The player then takes
          the perspective of Edith as she reexplores the house and discovers
          information relating to the circumstances of each relative's death,
          some of which are confused in authenticity by the unique mediums and
          perspectives of each source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edith explains that her family is believed to be cursed because of
          the untimely deaths they frequently experience. In 1937, in an
          effort to escape the curse after the death of his wife Ingeborg and
          newborn son Johann, Edith's great-great-grandfather Odin Finch
          emigrates from Norway to the United States. Alongside his family
          (his daughter Edith (Edith Sr., or 'Edie'), her husband Sven (n√©
          Hoffstad), and their newborn daughter Molly), he ferries his family
          house with them. However, waves off the shore of Orcas Island,
          Washington capsize the house and Odin drowns. The remaining family
          builds a new home and accompanying graveyard nearby. Here, Edie then
          gives birth to Barbara, Calvin and Sam, and Walter.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a while, Edie believes they have left the curse behind, but
          unusual tragedies begin to befall her family. At 10 years old, Molly
          dies after ingesting fluoridated toothpaste and holly berries; at
          16, Barbara is murdered during a home invasion or implied domestic
          dispute; at 11, Calvin falls to his death after swinging off the
          edge of a cliff; at 49, Edie's husband Sven dies during a
          construction accident at the house; and, at 53, after having spent
          30 years living as a recluse in a bunker beneath the house and
          traumatized at witnessing Barbara's death, Walter is hit by a train
          after stepping outside for the first time since. Edie memorializes
          each death by turning their respective bedrooms into shrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam marries a woman named Kay Carlyle, and they have three children:
          Dawn, Gus, and Gregory. However, Dawn is the only one to live to
          adulthood. At 22 months, Gregory drowns in the bathtub after being
          left unattended by his mother; and, at 13, Gus is crushed by a totem
          pole during a storm. Sam and Kay get a divorce, and, at 33, whilst
          on a hunting trip with Dawn, Sam falls to his death after being
          bucked from a cliff by a deer.

        <p>
          Traumatized, Dawn moves to Kolkata, India, marries Sanjay Kumar, and
          they have three children: Lewis, Milton, and Edith (Jr.). In 2002
          Sanjay dies in an earthquake and Dawn returns with her children to
          the Finch home. At 11 years old, Milton inexplicably disappears, and
          Dawn becomes paranoid. She seals off the memorialized bedrooms of
          the deceased and forbids her children from learning about their
          family history in an effort to save them from a similar fate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010, after struggling with substance abuse and mental illness,
          Lewis commits suicide at the age of 21. Now desperate, Dawn decides
          they must all leave the house. Edie, however, refuses to go, and,
          after a heated argument, Dawn and Edith flee the house without her,
          leaving most of their possessions behind. The next day, Edie is
          found dead at the age of 93, the cause of which implied to be
          complications due to consuming alcohol alongside her prescription
          medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seven years later, Dawn succumbs to an undisclosed illness, and
          17-year-old Edith inherits the property. Returning to the house,
          Edith discovers for herself the stories of her family's unique
          history, documenting her own thoughts and experiences in her
          journal. Edith reveals that she is pregnant and that the journal is
          intended for her unborn child in case she should die before she is
          able to tell them the stories herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final scene, the player character is revealed to be Edith's
          son Christopher, and that Edith has died during childbirth in 2017.
          In an unspecified time in the future, Christopher places flowers on
          his mother's grave.
